# Thor suite for Max4Live
Thor is a modular suite of OSC plugins
(require Max/Msp 6.0 or higher)

with a full set of listeners: dynamic, midi, transport,
spectrum, frequency, clip names
and a powerfull OSC sender allowing up to 8 IPs.

Thor suite is designed to be modular, and allow the user to make itâ€™s own system. The transport device allows to send all synchronisation data to the third party software. Bars, beats, tempo and ticks.

Thor allows to make 8 tracks fully monitored with midi, frequency and dynamic, 8 tracks with tracking of clip names and a single spectrum analyser on the master, with a minimum latency over the network.
